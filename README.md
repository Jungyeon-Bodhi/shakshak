## Tearfund
### Assessing the individual and collective effectiveness and impact of Tearfundâ€™s approaches to peacebuilding and sexual and gender based violence

This code is working based on four Python scripts (bodhi_PMF.py, bodhi_data_analysis.py, bodhi_data_preprocessing.py, bodhi_indicator.py)

The 'data_preprocessing.py' file handles data preprocessing tasks, including data anonymisation, and removing duplicates and missing values.

The 'bodhi_pipeline.py' file performs data analysis for this project. It runs statistical tests and creates descriptive statistics and visualisations for each indicator and social demographic.

Before running the data preprocessing script, please place the raw survey dataset in the "\data" folder.

Before running the data analysis script, please place the cleaned survey dataset in the "\data" folder.
